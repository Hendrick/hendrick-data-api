# Hendrick Pipeline Engine - Scaling Architecture

## Executive Summary

The Hendrick Pipeline Engine currently operates as a single-instance transformation service that processes Reynolds & Reynolds data files between immutable S3 storage and partner API stacks. While this design successfully handles the current data volume, scaling to accommodate increased file throughput from Reynolds & Reynolds requires addressing fundamental race condition risks and implementing distributed processing capabilities.

**Current Limitations:**
- Single pipeline engine instance creates processing bottleneck
- No race condition prevention for concurrent file processing
- Direct S3 event notifications lack coordination mechanisms
- No distributed locking or atomic operations for file claims
- Limited horizontal scaling capabilities

**Scaling Objectives:**
- Support multiple pipeline engine instances for increased throughput
- Eliminate race conditions when processing the same immutable files
- Implement reliable message delivery and processing coordination
- Enable auto-scaling based on file processing demand
- Maintain data integrity and processing reliability

```

### Race Condition Risks

**File Processing Conflicts:**
- Multiple pipeline instances could receive the same S3 event notification
- No mechanism to prevent duplicate processing of the same file
- Potential data corruption from concurrent transformation operations
- No atomic "claim" operations for file processing

**Resource Contention:**
- Shared S3 bucket access without coordination
- KMS encryption operations without process isolation
- Potential deadlocks in multi-step processing operations

**State Management Issues:**
- No centralized processing state tracking
- No detection of failed or stale processing operations
- Limited retry mechanisms for failed transformations

## Scaling Solutions

### 1. Message Queue-Based Coordination

**Amazon SQS Implementation:**
```
S3 Event → SQS Queue → Pipeline Engine Instances (Auto-scaling)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Visibility Timeout**: Ensures only one consumer processes each message
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Handles failed processing attempts
- **FIFO Queue Option**: Maintains processing order if required
- **Message Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate processing

**Benefits:**
- Reliable message delivery with at-least-once semantics
- Natural load balancing across multiple pipeline instances
- Built-in retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- CloudWatch integration for monitoring and alerting

### 2. Distributed Processing Coordination

**DynamoDB Coordination Table:**
```
ProcessingCoordination Table:
- file_path (Primary Key)
- processing_status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- processor_id (unique identifier for pipeline instance)
- claim_timestamp (when processing was claimed)
- heartbeat_timestamp (last activity from processor)
- completion_timestamp (when processing finished)
- ttl (automatic cleanup of old records)
```

**Atomic Operations:**
- **Claim File**: Conditional write to set processing status
- **Heartbeat Update**: Regular timestamp updates during processing
- **Release Claim**: Mark completion and cleanup
- **Stale Process Detection**: Identify and reclaim expired processes

### 3. Idempotent Processing Design

**Content-Based Processing IDs:**
- Generate unique processing ID from file content hash
- Enable safe retry of failed operations
- Detect and skip duplicate processing attempts
- Maintain processing audit trail

**Atomic Multi-Step Operations:**
- Break complex transformations into atomic steps
- Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- Use S3 versioning for intermediate processing states
- Maintain transaction logs for debugging

### 4. Auto-Scaling Implementation

**Scaling Metrics:**
- SQS queue depth (primary scaling trigger)
- Average processing time per file
- Error rate and retry frequency
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)

**Scaling Policies:**
- **Scale Out**: Add instances when queue depth exceeds threshold
- **Scale In**: Remove instances during low activity periods
- **Predictive Scaling**: Based on historical patterns
- **Emergency Scaling**: Rapid scale-out for high-priority files

## Transformation Extensibility Architecture

### Current Transformation Limitations

The current Pipeline Engine design assumes simple 1:1 transformations (XML file → single JSON file, CSD file → single JSON file) with static transformation logic. This approach breaks down when handling:

**Real-World Transformation Requirements:**
- **Multi-output transformations**: Single XML file creates separate JSON files for Parts, Sales, and Inventory
- **Aggregation transformations**: Multiple source files combined into summarized outputs
- **Partner-specific logic**: Custom transformation requirements for specific partners
- **Data enrichment**: Combining Reynolds & Reynolds data with external data sources
- **Conditional processing**: Different transformation logic based on dealership, file content, or business rules

### Extensible Transformation Architecture

#### 1. Transformation Pipeline Pattern

**Enhanced Processing Flow:**
```
Input File → Transformation Chain → Multiple Outputs
```

**Transformation Chain Components:**
- **Parser**: Extract data from source formats (XML, CSV, JSON)
- **Validator**: Ensure data quality and completeness
- **Transformer**: Apply business logic and field mapping
- **Enricher**: Add data from external sources or APIs
- **Splitter**: Create multiple outputs from single input
- **Aggregator**: Combine multiple inputs into single output
- **Encryptor**: Apply field-level encryption with partner-specific keys
- **Serializer**: Generate final JSON outputs with proper formatting

#### 2. Configuration-Driven Transformations

**Transformation Configuration Schema:**
```json
{
  "transformation_id": "xml_parts_enhanced_v2",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "input_pattern": "XML_PARTS_*.xml",
  "source_type": "xml",
  "transformation_chain": [
    {
      "type": "parser",
      "config": {"schema": "reynolds_parts_v1.xsd"}
    },
    {
      "type": "validator", 
      "config": {"required_fields": ["dealership_id", "part_number"]}
    },
    {
      "type": "enricher",
      "config": {
        "source": "parts_catalog_api",
        "fields": ["manufacturer", "category", "msrp"]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "splitter",
      "config": {
        "outputs": [
          {"name": "inventory", "filter": "status=in_stock"},
          {"name": "orders", "filter": "status=on_order"},
          {"name": "discontinued", "filter": "status=discontinued"}
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "encryptor",
      "config": {"fields": ["cost", "margin", "supplier_info"]}
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {"name": "inventory", "path": "processed/inventory/"},
    {"name": "orders", "path": "processed/orders/"},
    {"name": "discontinued", "path": "processed/discontinued/"}
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Plugin-Based Transformation Engine

**Transformation Plugin Architecture:**
- **Standard Plugins**: XML parser, CSV parser, JSON serializer, field encryptor
- **Custom Plugins**: Partner-specific business logic, external API integration
- **Aggregation Plugins**: Multi-file combination, summary generation
- **Validation Plugins**: Data quality checks, business rule validation

**Plugin Interface Example:**
```python
class TransformationPlugin:
    def execute(self, input_data, config):
        # Apply transformation logic
        return output_data
    
    def validate_config(self, config):
        # Validate plugin configuration
        return validation_result
        
    def get_output_schema(self):
        # Define expected output format
        return schema_definition
```

#### 4. Multi-Output Processing Coordination

**Enhanced Coordination Table Schema:**
```
TransformationJobs:
- job_id (Primary Key)
- input_file_path
- transformation_config_id
- status (claimed, processing, completed, failed)
- processor_id
- claim_timestamp
- expected_outputs (array of output paths)
- completed_outputs (array of completed output paths)
- progress_percentage
- current_step
- error_details (if failed)
- estimated_completion_time
```

**Multi-Output Processing Flow:**
1. **Job Claim**: Atomic claim with all expected outputs defined
2. **Chain Execution**: Execute transformation chain with progress tracking
3. **Output Tracking**: Update coordination table as each output completes
4. **Job Completion**: Mark job complete when all outputs are successfully generated
5. **Error Handling**: Partial completion tracking for retry scenarios

#### 5. Transformation Deployment Strategies

**Version Management:**
- **Semantic Versioning**: Major.Minor.Patch for transformation configurations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Multiple transformation versions run simultaneously
- **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy new transformations to file subset first
- **A/B Testing**: Compare transformation versions for performance and accuracy

**Deployment Options:**

**Configuration-Only Deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy new transformation config without code changes
aws s3 cp transformation_configs/xml_parts_v2.1.0.json s3://hendrick-pipeline-config/
# Pipeline engine auto-detects and loads new configuration
```

**Plugin Deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy custom transformation plugin
docker build -t hendrick-pipeline:v2.1.0 .
# Blue-green deployment with new plugin capabilities
```

**Hot Configuration Updates:**
```bash
# Runtime configuration update with rollout control
POST /pipeline/transformations/xml_parts_v2
{
  "config_url": "s3://hendrick-pipeline-config/xml_parts_v2.1.0.json",
  "rollout_percentage": 25,
  "rollback_threshold": 5
}
```

#### 6. Advanced Transformation Patterns

**Aggregation Transformations:**
```json
{
  "transformation_id": "daily_sales_summary",
  "input_pattern": "XML_SALES_*.xml",
  "aggregation_window": "daily",
  "transformation_chain": [
    {
      "type": "aggregator",
      "config": {
        "group_by": ["dealership_id", "sale_date"],
        "metrics": ["total_sales", "unit_count", "avg_price", "top_models"],
        "time_window": "24h"
      }
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {"name": "daily_summary", "path": "processed/summaries/daily/"}
  ]

### Branch-Level Authorization Architecture

**Partner Authorization Model:**
Partners are authorized at the branch level (AreaNumber) due to Hendrick's operational structure where multiple dealerships can share accounting areas but need data isolation by branch.

**Authorization Configuration:**
```json
{
  "partner_id": "acme_corp",
  "authorized_branches": [
    {
      "dealer_number": "170161325514576",
      "store_number": "01", 
      "area_number": "01",
      "access_level": "full"
    },
    {
      "dealer_number": "170161325514576", 
      "store_number": "01",
      "area_number": "02",
      "access_level": "summary_only"
    }
  ],
  "data_types": ["repair_orders", "parts_data"],
  "encryption_key_arn": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:account:key/acme-key-id"
}
```

**Branch-Level Data Flow:**
```
Reynolds & Reynolds XML → Pipeline Engine → Branch Extraction → Authorization Filter → Partner-Specific Outputs
```

**Data Filtering Logic:**
1. **Extract Branch Info**: Parse DealerNumber, StoreNumber, AreaNumber from XML
2. **Authorization Check**: Verify partner access to specific branch
3. **Data Transformation**: Apply branch-specific transformation rules
4. **Output Generation**: Create separate outputs per authorized branch
5. **Message Routing**: Send branch-specific notifications to authorized partners

**Partner Container Configuration:**
```json
{
  "container_config": {
    "partner_id": "acme_corp",
    "authorized_filter": {
      "branches": ["170161325514576:01:01", "170161325514576:01:02"],
      "data_types": ["repair_orders"],
      "date_range": "last_30_days"
    },
    "s3_access_patterns": [
      "processed/repair-orders/store-01/branch-01/*",
      "processed/repair-orders/store-01/branch-02/*",
      "processed/daily-summaries/store-01/branch-01/*",
      "processed/daily-summaries/store-01/branch-02/*"
    ]
  }
}
```
